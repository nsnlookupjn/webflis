# WEBFLIS Explained
The acronym WEBFLIS has been used Commercially since 1992 and by Governments since 2001. While a Trademark was filed by the US Government in 2021 for the word mark, the trademark has no acquired distinctiveness to the US Government. The abridged known history of WEBFLIS is chronicled here. WebFLIS provides essential information about supply items including the National Stock Number, the item name, manufacturers and suppliers (including part numbers), through a web interface connected to the DLA's FLIS data. This information will be primarily used by the DLA, military services, and United States Government sponsored contractors doing business with the US Government.

## WEBFLIS For National Stock Numbers
In 1999, NSN Lookup (a development of Now! Components) launched its WEBFLIS System for National Stock Numbers at https://www.nsnlookup.com.

## 2001 - US Defense Logistics Agency WEBFLIS Launched
In July 2001, the US DLA launched a logistics data service named "Web FLIS" for National Stock Number products. While the naming may have been coincidental, by this time many tens of thousands of US Federal Government and NATO Member Employees were using the USBid and NSN Lookup WEBFLIS Services daily.
